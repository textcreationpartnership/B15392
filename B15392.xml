            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Good Lord, that man should so hardly be brought to consider himselfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee! and yet so quickly to ioyne with his enemy, and maligne his brother; to forget, whose he is, whence he is, where he is, and which

In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof, I take this, with the <hi>current</hi> of our later writers, to be rather vnderstood of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>seede</hi> of the Word. Of which <hi>two things,</hi> are here intimated, first, their <hi>secrete increase,</hi> as the <hi>morning deaw,</hi> which is found vpon the grasse, though no vapour or cloud appeares from whence it hath descended; and <hi>secondly,</hi> their <hi>multitude,</hi> which as the <hi>morning drops,</hi> in euery age more multiply, then man can take notice of. The Spirit of God therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaseth from the propagating <hi>Christs Church,</hi> though men neglect their <hi>duties,</hi> &amp; all the world <hi>oppose</hi> it. And here I might take occasion to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course how the Church is sometimes <hi>inuisible,</hi> and yet euer <hi>fruitfull:</hi> sometimes, <hi>personated</hi> by <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and yet springing still as the <hi>corne</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>weedes,</hi> in <hi>persecution</hi> flourishing, in <hi>exile</hi> from one place, entertayned euer in another,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:178414:74"/> knowne still to bee by her members, but onely knowne to God, how many the members be. But I perceiue the time hath preuented me.

His <hi>Auditors</hi> were the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> great <hi>Critikes,</hi> prone to <hi>factions</hi> and <hi>emulations,</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much vpon their <hi>Philosophy</hi> and straines of <hi>subtilities,</hi> whereby the Apostles plaine course of <hi>teaching</hi> was contemned as vulgar, his Person vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derualued, his <hi>Followers</hi> esteemed <hi>weake</hi> and <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as his <hi>apologie</hi> discouereth in the foure first chapters.

No maruaile then if in a Church so tainted, some fell, out of their presumptuous profanenesse, to question al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:178414:77"/> the <hi>Resurrection:</hi> which, how the Apostle here meets with in this 15. chapter, may be noted far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a patterne for <hi>disputants</hi> in <hi>diuinitie</hi> to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate. For first he comes not vpon them with Philosophicall <hi>Quiddities,</hi> or apocryphall <hi>frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to iustifie an article of such consequence. Nay (sayth he) <hi>I haue deliuered vnto you, first of all that which I also haue receyued, how that Iesus Christ died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he rose againe the third day according to the Scriptures, verse</hi> 3, 4. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> therefore are the grounds, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Apostolike building. And that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> all things came to passe, hee bringeth in <hi>eye-witnesses,</hi> verse, 5.6. <hi>Cephas</hi> the <hi>Foreman,</hi> and if his word would not bee taken, an eleuen more of the same ranke to iustifie it. And in case also that these should bee excepted against, vpon a suspition of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; there are ready <hi>fiue hundred</hi> brethren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, which all saw Christ <hi>at once,</hi> after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and diuers were <hi>aliue</hi> at that time to witnesse it. And lest our Apostle might bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as too confident vpon <hi>heare-say,</hi> last of all he was <hi>seene of mee also</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>as of one borne out of due time,</hi> the <hi>last</hi> and the <hi>least;</hi> but all comes to one, <hi>for whether it be I or they, so we preach, and so yee beleeued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But heere the Corinthians might except, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting these proofes as strong for the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of Christ: Doth it thereupon also follow, that our bodyes shall likewise bee raysed? Yes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:178414:78"/> (sayth the blessed Apostl)e otherwise there were no auoiding of those prodigious absurdities; <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>fayth</hi> should be vaine, the <hi>Apostles</hi> found false <hi>witnesses,</hi> the <hi>liuing,</hi> in their sinnes, the <hi>dead, perished, Christians,</hi> of all professions the most <hi>miserable.</hi> Let a Scholler then gather the arguments, and he shall finde the first fairely <hi>categoricall:</hi> That which the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressedly deliuered, and so many eye-witnesses beyond exception are readie to auouch, must needes be true without contradiction, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied without impiety; But <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>witnesses</hi> are <hi>cleare for Christs Resurrection:</hi> therefore that is an argument beyond all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The second is <hi>Hypotheticall,</hi> forcing a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of intolerable <hi>absurdities.</hi> If Christians are not to rise againe by vertue of Christs Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as Christ did, then the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Apostles is a fopperie, the <hi>fayth</hi> of Christians, vaine, the <hi>forgiuenesse</hi> of their sinnes, a fancy, the <hi>hope</hi> of their dead, a delusion, their estate in this life, beyond all others the most wretched; but such <hi>inferences</hi> are no way to be indured; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be euer firmely held, that not onely Christ rose againe, but that Christians by vertue of his Resurrection, are also to be raysed. Vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troleable therefore is this <hi>minor proposition,</hi> which the Apostle here assumeth, <hi>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.</hi> I could not passe along this goodly <hi>Field of Corne</hi> (B.) without plucking <hi>some eares,</hi> which were eminent aboue the rest: for where may a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:178414:78"/> man presume rather then in such an Auditorie as this, where <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi> abound, and the deuill is most busie? that some are <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>factious,</hi> standing vpon their gifts, to the vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and discouraging of their weaker brethren? others profane &amp; peremptorie, to reiect all good order, irreuerently to abuse the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and turne all Gods graces in a <hi>customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wantonnesse?</hi> On the other side, what hearers may be imagined to be more vnderstanding of the <hi>Apostles Logike,</hi> for settling of their owne consciences against all <hi>Atheisticall opposers,</hi> and the profitable imparting of it to the strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of others? Euery one therefore in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage may <hi>rubbe</hi> out the <hi>Corne</hi> of such <hi>eares</hi> as hee liketh. I shall deale with the whole <hi>heape,</hi> which the Apostle hath here in good <hi>measure,</hi> and <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer,</hi> shaken together, in this narrow vessell: <hi>But now Christ is risen againe, and become the first fruits of them that slept.</hi>

That the Disciples might no way doubt of it, he foretells then in plaine tearmes, Matth. 20.18. <hi>Behold, we goe vp to Ierusalem, and the Sonne of man shalbe betrayed vnto the Chiefe Priests,</hi> and vnto the <hi>Scribes, and they shall condemne him to death, and shal deliuer him to the Gentiles to mocke, and to scourge,</hi> and <hi>to crucifie him, but the third day he shall rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi> And howsoeuer the Iewes tooke aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a speach of his to this purpose, <hi>Destroy this temple, and in three dayes I will rayse it vp, Iohn</hi> 2.19. and made it the chiefe ground of their <hi>accusation</hi> against him, Matth. 26.61. Yet their importunity

All these assurances before his Passion, make for the certainty of his Resurrection. But greater <hi>euidences</hi> follow after, that admit no delusion.

                     </note> (&amp; is by <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi>) how thence it should follow that wee shall also be raysed? This the Apostle wisely foresaw, and therefore maketh it good, by three inuincible arguments. Two are couched in these few words, <hi>He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the first fruits of them that slept.</hi> As the <hi>first fruits</hi> are accepted, so the whole masse speedeth, and those only that <hi>sleepe,</hi> shall haue a time to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake. The <hi>head</hi> aboue the water, the <hi>members</hi> can neuer be drowned. The third argument in the two next verses following, is of like force: <hi>As by man came death, so by man came the Resurrection, and if in Adam mans nature</hi> offending, became the <hi>prisoner</hi> of <hi>death:</hi> why in the same restored by the Son of God, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> assumed it to that purpose, should not al in the like sort be made aliue? It is true that some <hi>bodily</hi> rose againe before this <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as in the old <hi>Testament,</hi> the <hi>widowes son</hi> of <hi>Sarepta raysed</hi> by <hi>Elias,</hi> the <hi>Sunamites son</hi> by <hi>Elisha,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> also at the <hi>touch</hi> of the same <hi>Prophets bones</hi> in the Sepulcher, long <hi>after he was buryed: as also in the New, the Centurions daughter,</hi> the <hi>widowes son of Naim,</hi> putrified <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the brother of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Marie:</hi> But the case betweene <hi>their</hi> Resurrection and Christs, is much different.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:178414:86"/> First, in the <hi>effect,</hi> these rose not to liue immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, but to die againe, as the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> giue the reason. Secondly, in the <hi>efficient,</hi> Christ rose by his <hi>owne</hi> victorious power, but these by vertue of <hi>this Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as our reformed Writers more fully haue declared.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The order in which this shall come to passe, and <hi>how</hi> the <hi>dead</hi> shall be <hi>raysed,</hi> what <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> there shall be betweene these <hi>corruptible carcases of ours,</hi> and the same <hi>refined by this Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> how in the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> one <hi>Starre</hi> shall differ from another in <hi>glory,</hi> and what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of those that are found <hi>liuing</hi> vpon the earth, at the Lords comming, is fully <hi>added</hi> by our <hi>Apostle,</hi> in that which followeth my text, but without the compasse of my intended scope. These texts sufficiently illustrate the point I haue now in hand. Christ is the <hi>beginning,</hi> the <hi>first borne,</hi> Colos. 1.18. the <hi>first begotten</hi> of the <hi>dead,</hi> Apoca. 1.5. The <hi>fayth</hi> in whose <hi>Resurrection</hi> shall saue vs, Rom. 10.9. And therefore if wee beleeue, that <hi>Iesus died, and rose againe, euen so them also which sleep in Iesus, will God bring with him.</hi> Which conclusion is in the words of the Apostle, 1. Thes. 4.14. And this he so insisteth vpon in al his <hi>trials,</hi> as though the <hi>Creed of a Christian</hi> had consisted of no more <hi>articles.</hi> In his tossing betweene the <hi>Pharises</hi> &amp; <hi>Sadduces,</hi> Men and <hi>brethren</hi> (sayth he) <hi>I am a Pharise, the sonne of a Pharise,</hi> of the hope &amp; <hi>Resurrection of the dead I am called in question,</hi> Act. 23.6. After, before <hi>Felix</hi> the Gouernor, <hi>I haue hope towards God, which they themselues allow, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:178414:86"/> there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of iust and vniust,</hi> Act. 24.16. before <hi>Festus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> Why <hi>should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should rayse the dead?</hi> Chap. 26.6. <hi>And hauing therefore obtained helpe of God, I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue this witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things then these which Moses and the Prophets did say should come, that Christ should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and that he should bee the first that should rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and should shew light vnto the people and to the Gentiles,</hi> verse. 22.23. He had reference no doubt to that of <hi>Isaiah: Thy dead men shall liue, together with my dead body shall they rise: awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust, for thy dew is as the dew of hearbs, and the earth shall cast forth her dead,</hi> Chap. 26.19. But what seeke wee a surer discharge, then the <hi>Master</hi> himselfe of this <hi>first fruites Office</hi> affords vs, <hi>I am the Resurrection, and the life: Hee that beleeueth in me, though he were dead, yet shall hee liue?</hi> Iohn 11.25.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For farther amplifying of this point, I will not spend much time, to take notice of the ancient heresies concerning it, reduced to fiue heads, and refuted by <hi>Alphonsus de Castro.</hi> The first (granting the soules immortality) denyed only the bodies restoring, as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and his adherents, the <hi>Ophytes, Valentinians</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratians.</hi> The second, admitting the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bodie, imagined it to be so altered, and turned it a <hi>Spirit,</hi> that it could not be sayd to be the same. To refute this fancy, wherewith <hi>Eutychus Bishop of Constātinople</hi> much troubled the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:178414:87"/> Church, <hi>Gregorius</hi> (before he had the title of <hi>Great or Pope</hi>) made a iourney thither from <hi>Rome,</hi> and handled the matter so wisely before <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, that <hi>Eutychus</hi> booke <hi>de Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi> was adiudged to the fire. A fit dispatch also for the Diuelish pamphlets of <hi>Ostorodius</hi> and his <hi>damnable associates,</hi> which now in this Sunshine of the Gospell, (among diuers farre worse) set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broach the same opinion. And the Arminians (as the world seeth) are too ready to take after them. The third heresie is layd to the charge of <hi>Origen by Theophilus Aleaxandrinus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Paschal.</hi> 2.</note> as though he should hold the <hi>Resurrection of body</hi> with such a clause, that after it had risen once, and so flourished for certaine ages, it should againe be dissolued, and brought to nothing: but <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius cleereth Origen</hi> for this, burthening him with the flat deniall of the Resurrection of the body. In regard whereof, <hi>Alphonsus</hi> will credit neither of the relators, because their testimonies (sayth he) <hi>concerning Origen,</hi> doe not agree. As little heede is to be giuen to the imputations of <hi>Guido Carmelitanus</hi> against the <hi>Arminians,</hi> putting on them, that they hold Christ rose vpon the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> which <hi>Alphonsus</hi> makes the fourth Heresy. For who findes not by Fryer <hi>Waldensis,</hi> and <hi>Widdiford,</hi> against <hi>Wickliff, Peter Cluniacensis,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Petrobrusians, Bernard</hi> of <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> and others, against the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> what small trust is to be giuen to such relators, when the authors cannot be had, to speake for themselues? Last of all, there wanted not those who affirmed, that in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:178414:87"/> the Resurrection no <hi>women</hi> should be found, but all then should be <hi>turned into men;</hi> abusing that place of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Ephes. 4.13. of the growing of all vnto a <hi>perfit man, vnto the measure of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the stature of Christ.</hi> But Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> elegantly refutes them <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> lib. 22. cap. 17. interpreting man in that place to include, as <hi>homo,</hi> both <hi>sexes,</hi> and wittily concluding out of the 22. of Matthew, where our Sauiour tells vs, that in <hi>the Resurrection they neither marry, nor are giuen in marriage: erunt ergo qui vel nubere hic so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, vel ducere vxores, sed ibi hoc non faciunt.</hi> Therefore shall then (sayth he) <hi>be the parties which on earth were married, or marriageable,</hi> but <hi>there</hi> they shall be freed (as the <hi>Angels</hi>) from any such relations of <hi>man</hi> and <hi>wife.</hi> Now partly to giue some satisfaction to curious demaunders, but more I thinke out of their itching <hi>humours,</hi> to make worke for their wit; the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> haue presumed to define of the qualities of those that shall <hi>rise againe,</hi> of their <hi>stature, age, place, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, crownes, and coronets,</hi> more then our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, after his returne from the <hi>third heauen,</hi> euer thought fit to acquaint vs with. To better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a great deale the <hi>Fathers</hi> presse this point; <hi>Iustine Martyr, Athenagoras and Tertullian,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the <hi>Gentiles; Irenaeus, Ephrem,</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> to stop the mouthes of <hi>Heretikes, Gregorie Nissene; Chrysostome, Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> labour es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a <hi>concionatory</hi> and <hi>Pareneticall</hi> kinde of straine (wherein they were excellent) to settle the conscience, perswade the will, and strongly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:178414:88"/> to worke vpon the affection. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> bynds himselfe against the particular errours of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem: Damascen</hi> the <hi>Greeke</hi> master of the <hi>sentences,</hi> is full of collections out of the <hi>Ancients. Lactantius, Prudentius, Hilarie and Paulinus,</hi> tooke a delight to hallow their <hi>diuine</hi> straine in Poetrie with so sacred a subiect. <hi>Seduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> thought it not inough to in title the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Story</hi> of the Bible, which he had comprised in verse in foure bookes, <hi>Opus Paschale, Easter worke:</hi> but needes he must repeate the same againe in <hi>prose</hi> vnder the same title; which the last <hi>Bibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otheca Patrum</hi> hath now also taken in, from the library of <hi>Peter Pithaeus.</hi> The time allotted will scarce giue leaue, to point but at the scope of each of them. They neuer thought this doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> inough repeated, or suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently taught, or learned. Their Philosophicall answers out of the grounds of the <hi>Physikes,</hi> to shew the <hi>possibilitie</hi> of it, their <hi>reasons</hi> borrowed from the Ethikes, to proue how it stands with <hi>conueniency</hi> and <hi>iustice,</hi> and their excellent <hi>simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes</hi> of the <hi>Phenix, corne▪</hi> the <hi>rising</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> after his <hi>setting,</hi> and the like to illustrate the same, are testimonies of their extraordinary lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, paynes, and piety, and patternes for vs to follow, in the due consideration of so Sacred a Mysterie.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But alasse (B.) our thoughts (for the most part) are taken vp with other matters: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monnesse of this great treasure, maketh vs all to vnder-value it; wee can talke of it vpon occasion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:178414:88"/> acknowledge it to be an especiall <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Creede,</hi> brand with the deserued note of <hi>Infidell,</hi> him that in any sort should <hi>question</hi> it: and yet come too short (God wot) in the due esteeme of our <hi>Sauiours</hi> conquest of death, the primarie and meritorious cause of it, or of the vertue of the <hi>first fruits,</hi> whereby the whole <hi>masse</hi> is hallowed, or the happy condition of those, who are not <hi>dead,</hi> but <hi>sleepe,</hi> and reposed in their graues, as in a bed, at the voyce of the last <hi>Trumpe</hi> to awake againe. Surely our <hi>Apostle</hi> accounted all things but <hi>drosse</hi> and <hi>dung,</hi> in regard of this Knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>the power of his Resurrection,</hi> Philip. 3.10.

S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> giues the reason in his sixth booke and 39. <hi>Epistle,</hi> because true <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>security</hi> keepe their residence in <hi>heauen</hi> onely, and not here on earth: and therefore (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> writes to <hi>Celestinus</hi> in his 63.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:178414:94"/> plead their Prerogatiue: but being in the same ship with their inferiours, they are forced to runne the hazard of the same tempests. So gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that old verse falleth out to be true,
<q>Interdum pax est, pacis fiducia nunquam.</q> Aboue many others, a man would haue thought <hi>King Dauid,</hi> a King of Gods owne making, a <hi>man after his owne heart,</hi> so beloued at home, so feared abroade, so compassed on euery side with inward and outward blessings, had at length beene sufficiently guarded from any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary attempts of <hi>traytours</hi> or <hi>treason.</hi> Hee had so miraculously escaped <hi>Saul,</hi> subdued the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims,</hi> recouered <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from the obstinate <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busites,</hi> the finger of God appeared in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and victories, he wanted not friends, and kinred, his Captaines and Souldiours were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, his sonnes many and towardly, his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure boundlesse, and his owne valour and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience famous amongst his subiects and borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, so that <hi>desperatenesse</hi> it selfe might haue trembled to haue giuen him the onset: Yet the text here sheweth, that as the best men haue their faults, so Gods dearest children want not their crosses. In the matter of <hi>Vriah, Dauid</hi> in three respects had beene scandalously too blame, in <hi>murder, adulterie,</hi> and the vnder-hand <hi>betraying</hi> of a poore Innocent. The first whereof, God repayed by the murder of his owne sonne <hi>Ammon,</hi> and the death of the childe begotten in <hi>adulterie.</hi> The second, by the deflowring first of his daughter <hi>Tamar,</hi> by her owne brother, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:178414:94"/> then of his owne wiues, by his incestuous son <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom;</hi> who as he raised out of his owne bowels to turne <hi>traytour</hi> against him, (as appeareth in the fiue former chapters) so here he ordereth the malice of <hi>Sheba</hi> to rayse another commotion, iustly punishing <hi>sinne</hi> by <hi>sinne,</hi> and working his owne ends, by such peruerse instruments. The brand therefore of <hi>Absalom</hi> is scarce here quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when <hi>Sheba</hi> steps forth to blow new coales of <hi>rebellion;</hi> Of which <hi>trecherous attempt</hi> of a disloyall and false-hearted subiect, against his most religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lawfull <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> I haue taken in hand vpon this <hi>day</hi> and occasion, especially to treate of.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>occasions,</hi> aduantagious, the traytour, malicious, the <hi>treason,</hi> perilous. As the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnexpectedly, drawes on the <hi>traytour;</hi> so the <hi>traytour</hi> violently sets on foote the treason. Whence we may easily gather, the <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,</hi> the <hi>rancour</hi> of <hi>disloyalty,</hi> and the vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>leuity</hi> of an incensed multitude; And for memory we may thus connect it: When <hi>occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is offered, (howsoeuer they otherwise striue to appeare good subiects) <hi>traytours</hi> will bee euer ready to vent their treasons. Of all which, whiles I shall plainely discourse according to my <hi>tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous prouision,</hi> I trust, my <hi>occasions</hi> shall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge me from those sinister censures which passe vpon matters without due notice of circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

As on the other side who seeth not, that <hi>Sheba's</hi> inueterate malice was ordred to be dis-vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zord, and punished, by such a publike attempt, and shame? Howsoeuer this, we may build vpon

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:178414:98"/> (as <hi>Ioabs</hi> was) and will bee the readier to strike you vpon any aduantage giuen them. <hi>Godoliah</hi> was too confident on his owne <hi>innocency,</hi> and the loyalty of those that spake him fayre; whereupon when hee was truly informed by <hi>Iohanan</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that <hi>Ismael</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nethaniah,</hi> was suborned by <hi>Baalis</hi> King of <hi>Ammon,</hi> to slay him, he beleeued them not; but answered <hi>Iohanan</hi> in anger, <hi>Thou speakest falsly of Ismael;</hi> Ier. 40. and the last verse. But the euent prooued it too true; for his security gaue the aduantage, which the traytor taking, performed that most wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe; which made all the miserable remnant of <hi>Israel</hi> to smart for it. In consideration whereof, no doubt, <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and the chiefe of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> returned from the captiuity, tooke after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a better course, Ezra 4. For when the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous enemies of the Church, made a proffer to ioyne with them in the reedifying of the Temple: No (say they) <hi>you haue nothing to doe with vs to build a house vnto our God, but we our selues together will build it to the Lord God of Israel.</hi> So suspicious were they, that they who remayne false-hearted to God, would neuer prooue trusty to his faithfull seruants. <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe in diuers places complaines of such kinde of people, in the fiue and thirtieth Psal. <hi>When they were sicke</hi> (saith he) <hi>I put on sackcloth, and humbled my selfe with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting; I behaued my selfe as though it had been my friend, or my brother, I went heauily as one that mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for his mother.

Psalme: <hi>For if an open enemy or aduersary had dishonoured, or magnified himselfe against me, I could perchance haue borne it, at least hid my selfe from him:</hi> but when they that professe <hi>religion,</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> shall proue the vilest miscreants, this is that the earth will groane to beare; and heauen will not suffer vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged.

I need not to goe beyond sea for instances. Were they euer quiet in <hi>Queene Elizabeth's</hi> dayes? or hath the mercy of our gracious <hi>Soueraigne</hi> (whom God so miraculously hath so often freed from their villany) wrought in them any remorse of conscience? No surely (Beloued,) for seeing the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe hath mounted to this height, onely by such treasonable practices against his owne Prince and others; when they hold such grounds in their <hi>Schooles,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> may loose, and <hi>make voyde</hi> the <hi>oath of allegiance</hi> that subiects haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

What hope (I say) may remaine that such, so bred, so taught, so beleeuing, will euer proue Loyall? When they confesse their poore <hi>conformitie,</hi> they yeeld for the time, to be for <hi>want</hi> of strength, which should soone appeare in other colours, if <hi>Sheba's aduantage</hi> were once giuen: The more it stands <hi>good Subiects</hi> vpon, to be soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, and watchfull for their Princes safetie. <hi>Nets,</hi> and <hi>snares,</hi> and <hi>ginnes,</hi> and <hi>pits,</hi> and <hi>traps,</hi> were not onely layd for <hi>Dauid,</hi> but are renewed daily, against such religious Princes, as make conscience to treade in <hi>Dauids</hi> footsteps.

Because the King putteth his trust in thee, O Lord, and in thy mercy (we trust) he shall neuer miscarry. Let all his enemies (O Lord) feele thy hand, let thy right hand find out them that hate him.

                     <hi>giue leaue.</hi> And first, of the first, which is <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah's</hi> sicknesse, in these words:</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In those dayes Hezekiah was sicke to the death]</hi> A sorry entrance to continue, if the remedy bee not the sooner. For sicknesse is the dashing of all <hi>worldly delights:</hi> And true <hi>happinesse</hi> cannot har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, where that hath taken vp a lodging. <hi>But he that goeth on this way weeping, and beareth forth good seede, shall doubtlesse come againe with ioy, and bring his sheaues with him.</hi> It would be tedious for you to heare, or me to vndertake the clearing of all those doubts that Interpreters out of these words haue <hi>raysed,</hi> rather then resolued. As first, concerning the <hi>time</hi> of this <hi>sicknesse,</hi> whether it were before, or after the miraculous deliuery from <hi>Sennacheribs Inuasion.</hi> Most of the <hi>Iewish Rabbins,</hi> with <hi>Salomon Iarche,</hi> and <hi>Kimchi;</hi> &amp; the <hi>Papists,</hi> with <hi>Abulensis</hi> and <hi>Lyra,</hi> together with some of reformed, as <hi>Musculus</hi> and <hi>Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> hold that it was before. Their grounds are two: Otherwise (say they) how could <hi>Hezekiah</hi> raigne but iust nine and twenty yeeres, seeing fifteene yeeres were added by miracle, after his <hi>sicknes,</hi> and in the fourteenth yeere of his raygne, <hi>Sennacherib</hi> came against him. Now, likely it is, that so many great matters could not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in <hi>one yeere.</hi> Besides, he hath a promise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his sicknesse, to be <hi>deliuered from the King of Assyria,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 20.16. Which argueth, that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance was not past before. Notwithstanding Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine, Luther, Caluine,</hi> and the <hi>maior</hi> part of our Interpreters, who take
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:178414:127"/> after them, out of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> suppose all the warre first ended, before this sicknesse <hi>began.</hi> First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the order of the text (in all three places where it is mentioned) so casteth it. And next, in all these tumults, we finde <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> either consulting with the Prophet, or praying in the Temple, or giuing directions to his people and Councel, or otherwise bestirring himself, without any mention of any sicknesse. And well might all these troubles come within the compasse of one yeere, (as <hi>Serrarius</hi> the Iesuite against his owne side granteth) to wit, that fourteenth they speake of, wherein <hi>Sennacherib</hi> came, and was defeated, <hi>Hezekiah sickned,</hi> recouered and liued 15. yeeres after, to make vp the nine and twenty. Now, in that God promised to deliuer him <hi>after</hi> his <hi>sicknesse,</hi> it might not be from the <hi>Assyrians</hi> first <hi>Inuasion,</hi> but from his returne againe, that was perchance both threatned, and feared, as the latter opinion (I thinke) more probably defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. So the meaning of the text will fall out to be, (according to this interpretation) <hi>In those</hi> dayes.] that is, not before, or amidst, but after all troubles were ended, when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had best reason to thinke himselfe most secure. When many brought <hi>Gifts,</hi> and <hi>presents</hi> vnto him (as the words are immediately before my text) <hi>so that he was magnified in the sight of all Nations, then,</hi> in the <hi>middest</hi> of his <hi>Prosperitie,</hi> when he (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance) thought least on it, was he seazed vpon with this <hi>deadly sicknesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now <hi>what manner of sicknesse</hi> this should
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:178414:127"/> be, Authours also vary; some would haue it to be the <hi>Kings Euill,</hi> as <hi>Aquila, Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Theodosion.</hi> Others, an <hi>Impostumation. Glyaus</hi> sayth, that it was in his <hi>foote,</hi> which began to <hi>rot.</hi> Most coniecture it to be the <hi>Plague,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Byle</hi> that appeared outwardly, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <hi>danger</hi> of life. But such coniectures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Text, are vayne and needlesse. Of like nature are the <hi>causes</hi> of this <hi>sicknesse,</hi> which by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are rendred. One is thought to be the <hi>Kings</hi> refusing to <hi>marry,</hi> vpon a conceit that he was that <hi>Immanuel,</hi> the <hi>Virgins Sonne,</hi> promised a little before to his <hi>Father Ahaz.</hi> So <hi>R. Salomon, Lyra, and Glycas,</hi> in the 2. part of his Annals. But <hi>Abulensis</hi> confutes this maynely, and <hi>most Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters</hi> are ashamed of it. Others, with the scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasticall Historie, affirme, that this sicknesse was a <hi>punishment,</hi> for the Kings neglect of <hi>thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing,</hi> after the ouerthrow of <hi>Sennacherib.</hi> But <hi>Iosephus,</hi> (who tooke most payne to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such matters in the historie of his Countrie) expresseth particularly the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Solemnities</hi> that vpon that occasiō were vsed. Besides we may adde, that no fault is layd to this <hi>good Kings</hi> charge before his sicknesse, but after. More safely then we may cōclude with S. <hi>Herome</hi> vpon the. 38. of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> That this disease was rather a restraint from <hi>future presumption,</hi> then a <hi>punishment for</hi> former sinnes.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:178414:128"/> He that proues not a good student in this <hi>Schoole</hi> of the <hi>Crosse,</hi> hath small hopes to attaine hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to any <hi>degree</hi> in heauen.

So here, good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in the height of his prosperity, is remembred with a sicknesse; to minde the <hi>greatest,</hi> of their <hi>frailety,</hi> and the <hi>holiest,</hi> of their <hi>humiliation,</hi> and the <hi>happiest,</hi> not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon their owne <hi>abilities;</hi> much more the meanest here should learne, with <hi>patience</hi> to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe such crosses, as their betters haue borne, and with <hi>compassion</hi> not to <hi>censure,</hi> but to <hi>comfort</hi> their afflicted brethren. For canst thou murmure if God should <hi>visit thee,</hi> when thou considerest that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was sicke? or account thy payne too <hi>greeuous,</hi> when his was to the <hi>death?</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine</hi> it comes vnseasonably, seeing this happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him <hi>in those dayes,</hi> wherein nothing was expected but ioy and triumphes?

Blessed King! it was Gods extraordinary grace that settled thee in this directest course; some would sooner haue

Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> takes the reason to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the standers by might not behold his teares: and <hi>Lyra,</hi> that they might not hinder him, as <hi>Angelomus</hi> further notes, by <hi>disturbing</hi> his deuotion.

The forme of his prayer is set downe in the twentieth of the 26. of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Esay</hi> the 38. in the same words, to teach vs to regard that the more, which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> vouchsafeth so precisely to <hi>repeat.</hi> From whence if our <hi>Puritanes</hi> hope to draw any instance for their <hi>extemporary brabbling,</hi> and brawling against our <hi>set formes</hi> of prayers; the text will shew them, as repugnant to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> herein, as commonly they are otherwise to all their <hi>lawfull Superiours.</hi> For his prayer here was on his <hi>bed,</hi> vpon his <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> and <hi>extraordinary necessity;</hi> they must vent theirs in the <hi>Church,</hi> where no such occasion is offered, to the excluding of <hi>better formes,</hi> then their best premeditation can affoord vs. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah turned</hi> his face to the <hi>wall,</hi> that this particular request of his might not be heard, or disturbed: The gift of these mē is vnder-valued, if their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes</hi> be not about them to applaud, and admire it.
